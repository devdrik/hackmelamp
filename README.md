# HackMeLamp

This is HackMeLamp. It will be a fun hackable lamp. For now it is just work in progress.

## bug hunt

~~Current problem is the MPU-6050 IC. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/devdrik/hackmelamp/issues/1) concerning this problem.~~

For now this repo only contains the schematics and board, ~~because it needs debugging. Feel free to commment on the [issue](https://github.com/devdrik/hackmelamp/issues/1)~~ if you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me on instagram ([@_devdrik](https://www.instagram.com/_devdrik/)) ~~if you think you can help me out!~~

Thank you in advance.

## after the fix

Once I have a working version of the HackMeLamp, the whole project will go open source!
