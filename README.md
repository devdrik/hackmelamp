# HackMeLamp

This is HackMeLamp. It is a fun hackable lamp. 
It has 16 RGB LEDs, an ESP8266 ÂµC and an MPU6050 acceleration sensor.

## State of HackMeLamp

HackMeLamp has reached a working state! The PCB works (though I have not yet tested the latest version, but I am using a Version with the same fixes). The code still needs refactoring and features, but it can be used.

HackMeLamp is meant to be a nice lamp that you can use as a backlight for lithophanes. But you can use its motion sensor to activate WiFi. Once you logged into that WiFi you can use the REST API to configure the lamp.
You can find more information on the [blog post](https://devdrik.de/hackmelamp/). 

Feel free to add features or refactor the code.

Also I am very happy for input if you spot bad practices
