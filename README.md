# hackmelamp

This is HackMeLamp. It will be a fun hackable lamp. For now it is just work in progress.

## bug hunt

Current problem is the MPU-6050 IC. It is not working properly. I can actually sometimes establish a connection to it using the [MPU6050 lib by jrowberg](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050). But I only receive 0's. Most of the time the connection just fails.

For now this repo only contains the schematics and board, because it needs debugging. Feel free to open an issue or contact me on instagram ([@_devdrik](https://www.instagram.com/_devdrik/)) if you think you can help me out! Thank you in advance.

Once I have a working version of the HackMeLamp, the whole project will go open source!
